# AWS Cloud Computing – Linux EC2 Instance Setup 🚀

This repository documents my **hands-on learning journey in Cloud Computing using Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.  
The project covers **AWS account creation, Linux EC2 instance deployment, security configuration, remote access, and hosting files on the cloud**.

This work represents my **first practical step into cloud infrastructure and AWS services**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand the **fundamentals of cloud computing** by deploying and managing a **Linux Virtual Machine (EC2 instance)** on AWS.

Key objectives:
- Learn AWS account setup and Free Tier usage
- Deploy a Linux-based EC2 instance
- Configure secure access using SSH
- Understand AWS Security Groups (firewall rules)
- Enable remote desktop access (RDP)
- Host files using an HTTP server

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
  - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
  - Security Groups
- **Linux (Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS)**
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**
- **PuTTY (Windows SSH client)**
- **XRDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**
- **Python HTTP Server**
- **Basic Linux CLI commands**

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A valid **email address**
- **Debit/Credit card** (Visa/Mastercard or Sadapay/Nayapay)
- Phone number for AWS verification
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands
- AWS Free Tier eligibility

---

## 🚀 What I Implemented

### 1️⃣ AWS Account Creation
- Created an AWS account
- Completed billing and phone verification
- Selected **Basic Support (Free)** plan

### 2️⃣ EC2 Instance Deployment
- Launched a **t2.micro** (Free Tier eligible) instance
- Selected **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS**
- Generated and configured SSH key pairs

### 3️⃣ Secure Remote Access
- Connected to EC2 instance using **SSH**
- Configured **Security Groups** for:
  - SSH (Port 22)
  - HTTP (Port 80)
  - RDP (Port 3389)

### 4️⃣ Remote Desktop Setup
- Installed lightweight desktop environment (XFCE)
- Configured **XRDP** for GUI-based access
- Connected via Windows Remote Desktop

### 5️⃣ Hosting Files on Cloud
- Created HTML and text files
- Hosted them using **Python HTTP Server**
- Accessed hosted content via public IP

## 🌐 Project Output

- Live Linux VM running on AWS EC2
- Accessible via:
  - SSH (terminal)
  - RDP (graphical interface)
  - Web browser (HTTP server)

---

## 📷 Screenshots & Documentation

All steps are documented in detail inside the provided assignment document, including:
- AWS Console setup
- Instance launch
- Security group configuration
- SSH and RDP access
- Web hosting verification

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical understanding of:
- Cloud infrastructure basics
- Linux server management
- Cloud security fundamentals
- Real-world deployment workflow
- AWS Free Tier best practices

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

After completing the setup and documentation, the EC2 instance should be **stopped or terminated** to avoid unnecessary charges.

---

## 📈 Future Scope

- Automating deployments using scripts
- Exploring AWS IAM and monitoring services
- Learning Docker and CI/CD pipelines
- Advancing toward DevOps practices
